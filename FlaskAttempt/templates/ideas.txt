make it so you can have a couple differente schedules and this way you could have different plans

add __repr__ to the course class

start work on calculating all possible schedule combinations
after that could work on creating a build-your-own schdule where a user go semester by semester picking classes
create ability to create all possible schedules

display schedules in order of least to most range of credits instead of only displaying the schedules with the least range
create schedules with different curves of the ranges of credits e.g. heaviest semester near the end

create a better way to compare if two schedules are the same
    implement with __eq__ i think its called


add better css styling on all DOM elements

seperate the valid schedule button and save fav schedule button


make it so the credit semester sums show on schedule in edit schdule
